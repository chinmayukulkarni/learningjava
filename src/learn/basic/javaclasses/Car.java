	// Global Variables
	// What:
	// What is firstname and what is lastname.
	// A rule of thumb is: Global variables are 'nouns' for e.g. Weight, height, name etc.
	// Functions
	// How: 
	// How to get role number?
	// How to get a name?
	// A rule of thumb is : Function names are 'verbs' for e.g. getFirstName() // printStudents() etc.
	
	
	
	
	// Classes are of two types
	// You cannot differentiate between two types just by looking at it.
	// 1) This type of class focuses on the operation/functions
	// 2) POJO (Plain old java object) This type of class is usually a data structure to hold values.
	// This class does not contain any core business functions. It only contains attributes and getter/setters
